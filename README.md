# Screen Lighter

Screen Lighter is a small Android app to conveniently increase the screen
brightness level, especially for users who don't want to enable adaptive
brightness.

Launch the app for the first time to give it permission to modify system
settings. Then, add an app shortcut to your home screen. Now when you unlock
your screen outside and the screen isn't bright enough, you can tap the app
shortcut to increase the brightness level instead of trying to slide the
notification shade down and locate the brightness icon to drag.
